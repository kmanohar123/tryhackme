Abusing Suid/Guid files:---
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Finding and Exploiting SUID Files

The first step in Linux privilege escalation exploitation is to check for files with the SUID/GUID bit set. This means that the file or files can be run with the permissions of the file(s) owner/group. In this case, as the super-user. We can leverage this to get a shell with these privileges!

What is an SUID binary?

As we all know in Linux everything is a file, including directories and devices which have permissions to allow or restrict three operations i.e. read/write/execute. So when you set permission for any file, you should be aware of the Linux users to whom you allow or restrict all three permissions. Take a look at the following demonstration of how maximum privileges (rwx-rwx-rwx) look:

r = read

w = write

x = execute

    user     group     others

    rwx       rwx       rwx

    421       421       421

The maximum number of bit that can be used to set permission for each user is 7, which is a combination of read (4) write (2) and execute (1) operation. For example, if you set permissions using "chmod" as 755, then it will be: rwxr-xr-x.


But when special permission is given to each user it becomes SUID or SGID. When extra bit “4” is set to user(Owner) it becomes SUID (Set user ID) and when bit “2” is set to group it becomes SGID (Set Group ID).

Therefore, the permissions to look for when looking for SUID is:

SUID:

rws-rwx-rwx

GUID:

rwx-rws-rwx

Finding SUID Binaries

We already know that there is SUID capable files on the system, thanks to our LinEnum scan. However, if we want to do this manually we can use the command: "find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null" to search the file system for SUID/GUID files. Let's break down this command.

find - Initiates the "find" command

/ - Searches the whole file system

-perm - searches for files with specific permissions

-u=s - Any of the permission bits mode are set for the file. Symbolic modes are accepted in this form

-type f - Only search for files

2>/dev/null - Suppresses errors

Exploiting a writable /etc/passwd

Continuing with the enumeration of users, we found that user7 is a member of the root group with gid 0. And we already know from the LinEnum scan that /etc/passwd file is writable for the user. So from this observation, we concluded that user7 can edit the /etc/passwd file.

Understanding /etc/passwd

The /etc/passwd file stores essential information, which  is required during login. In other words, it stores user account information. The /etc/passwd is a plain text file. It contains a list of the system’s accounts, giving for each account some useful information like user ID, group ID, home directory, shell, and more.

The /etc/passwd file should have general read permission as many command utilities use it to map user IDs to user names. However, write access to the /etc/passwd must only limit for the superuser/root account. When it doesn't, or a user has erroneously been added to a write-allowed group. We have a vulnerability that can allow the creation of a root user that we can access.

Understanding /etc/passwd format

The /etc/passwd file contains one entry per line for each user (user account) of the system. All fields are separated by a colon : symbol. Total of seven fields as follows. Generally, /etc/passwd file entry looks as follows:

    test:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash

[as divided by colon (:)]

    Username: It is used when user logs in. It should be between 1 and 32 characters in length.
    Password: An x character indicates that encrypted password is stored in /etc/shadow file. Please note that you need to use the passwd command to compute the hash of a password typed at the CLI or to store/update the hash of the password in /etc/shadow file, in this case, the password hash is stored as an "x".
    User ID (UID): Each user must be assigned a user ID (UID). UID 0 (zero) is reserved for root and UIDs 1-99 are reserved for other predefined accounts. Further UID 100-999 are reserved by system for administrative and system accounts/groups.
    Group ID (GID): The primary group ID (stored in /etc/group file)
    User ID Info: The comment field. It allow you to add extra information about the users such as user’s full name, phone number etc. This field use by finger command.
    Home directory: The absolute path to the directory the user will be in when they log in. If this directory does not exists then users directory becomes /
    Command/shell: The absolute path of a command or shell (/bin/bash). Typically, this is a shell. Please note that it does not have to be a shell.

How to exploit a writable /etc/passwd

It's simple really, if we have a writable /etc/passwd file, we can write a new line entry according to the above formula and create a new user! We add the password hash of our choice, and set the UID, GID and shell to root. Allowing us to log in as our own root user!
