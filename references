There is never a "magic" answer in the huge area that is Linux Privilege Escalation. This is simply a few examples of basic things to watch out for when trying to escalate privileges.The only way to get better at it, is to practice and build up experience. Checklists are a good way to make sure you haven't missed anything during your enumeration stage, and also to provide you with a resource to check how to do things if you forget exactly what commands to use.

Below is a list of good checklists to apply to CTF or penetration test use cases.Although I encourage you to make your own using CherryTree or whatever notes application you prefer.

More Practice

A good place to go for more practice is: https://tryhackme.com/room/privescplayground . It's a really great room to practice SUID and Sudo vulnerability enumeration and privilege escalation.

Thank you

Thanks for taking the time to work through this room, I wish you the best of luck in future.
